# ETLLoadPipelineNotification

A fully automated, event-driven ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using core AWS services: **S3, Lambda, Glue, EventBridge, SNS, and CloudWatch**.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This repository demonstrates how to set up a **serverless ETL workflow** on AWS.  
The pipeline is triggered when data is uploaded to S3, processed with AWS Glue, and monitored through email notifications and logging.

### Automated Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Upload a CSV file to the `extract/` folder in an S3 bucket.  
2. **Event Trigger**: S3 invokes a Lambda function when a CSV file is uploaded.  
3. **ETL Processing**: Lambda starts a Glue job to transform data (e.g., drop duplicates) and load it into the `load/` folder in S3.  
4. **Event Tracking**: Glue job status (success/failure) is sent to EventBridge.  
5. **Notification**: EventBridge forwards events to SNS, which emails subscribers.  
6. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs provide visibility for auditing and troubleshooting.  

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3** ‚Üí Source & destination for data files  
- **AWS Lambda** ‚Üí Orchestrates the workflow & triggers Glue jobs  
- **AWS Glue** ‚Üí ETL job execution (visual editor or Python script)  
- **Amazon EventBridge** ‚Üí Tracks and routes job status events  
- **Amazon SNS** ‚Üí Sends success/failure notifications via email  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** ‚Üí Centralized logging and monitoring  

## üìã Prerequisites
- An **AWS account**  
  - Glue is **not free tier**; S3, Lambda, EventBridge, SNS, and CloudWatch have limited free-tier usage  
- Basic familiarity with the **AWS Console**  
- **Python knowledge** for Lambda scripting  

## ‚ö° Quick Start
Clone this repository to access example Lambda code and IAM policy templates.  
Follow the guide (or the referenced YouTube tutorial) to:

- Create S3 buckets and folders  
- Set up Lambda triggers and IAM permissions  
- Build and configure a Glue ETL job  
- Connect Glue job status to EventBridge & SNS for notifications  
- Enable CloudWatch for monitoring  
- Customize Lambda and Glue for your use case  

## üí° Key Features
- **Event-driven automation** ‚Üí Upload a file to start the pipeline  
- **Flexible ETL** ‚Üí custom Python scripts  
- **Real-time alerts** ‚Üí Email notifications on job completion or failure  
- **Comprehensive monitoring** ‚Üí Integrated CloudWatch logs
